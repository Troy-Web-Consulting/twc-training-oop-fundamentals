Since this is a console application, a prompt has been added to the end of `Program.cs` to detect if the program is running in debug mode. If can detect that it is running in debug, it will not shut down until you hit your `enter` key or restart your debugger.

## Installation
You will need to install [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) to run this project, however it will run on both Windows and Mac!
